NAME

    FCGI::Daemon - Perl-aware Fast CGI daemon for use with nginx web server.

VERSION

    Version 0.20140325

SYNOPSIS

    This is executable FastCGI daemon i.e. modulino (it doesn't have any
    Perl-module functionality).

DESCRIPTION

    FCGI::Daemon is a small FastCGI server for use as CGI-wrapper for CGI
    applications.

    Like mod_perl FCGI-Daemon stay persistent in memory and accelerate
    unmodified CGI applications written in Perl.

    FCGI-Daemon run CGI scripts with RLIMITs and predefined number of
    workers.

    It was developed as replacement for cgiwrap-fcgi.pl
    (<http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI>) and fcgiwrap
    (<http://nginx.localdomain.pl/wiki/FcgiWrap>)

    Unlike fcgiwrap, FCGI-Daemon correctly passing STDERR to web server.

    FCGI-Daemon check for executable in path and correctly set PATH_INFO
    environment variable which is crucial for some CGI applications like
    fossil (<http://fossil-scm.org>). (Lack of this functionality make
    cgiwrap-fcgi.pl unsuitable for some scripts.)

FEATURES

    * drop privileges when run as root * setrlimit for RLIMIT_AS and
    RLIMIT_CPU * detection of script executable in path (PATH_INFO) * DOing
    .pl - run CGI scripts in Perl with persistent interpreter (like
    mod_perl). * detection of memory leaks

USAGE

    It can be manually invoked as "perl /usr/share/perl5/FCGI/Daemon.pm" or
    with included SysV init script.

    Please make sure that user should have write permissions for sock file.

OPTIONS

    Options: (default arguments given for convenience)

      -h                              # brief help message
      -w 1                            # number of preforked processes (workers)
      -q 96                           # max queue
      -m 512                          # RLIMIT_AS in MiB (see setrlimit)
      -c 32                           # RLIMIT_CPU in seconds (see setrlimit)
      -e 10240                        # max evals before process restart. 0 disables DOing perl scripts.
      -f \.pl                         # regex to match script file name
                                       # script will be evaluated on match (if -e parameter allows)
                                       # otherwise fallback to CGI exec mode.
                                       # EXAMPLE: -f \.pl|perlcgi/[^/]+\.cgi
      -l 1.3                          # memory leak threshold
      -p /var/run/fcgi-daemon.pid     # write pId (process ID) to given file (only if daemonize)
      -s /var/run/fcgi-daemon.sock    # socket file for Fast CGI communication
      -u www-data                     # user name to become (if run as root)
      -g www-data                     # group name to become (if run as root)
      -d                              # daemonize (run in background)
      --manager_proc_name FCGI::Daemon        # name to use for the manager process.
      --worker_proc_name  FCGI::Daemon-worker # name to use for the worker processes.

    All options are optional.

    -e  By default FCGI::Daemon DOing .pl scripts up to -e times. This is
        several times faster than invoking Perl for every call of CGI
        script. This option define how often parent process (worker) should
        restart. Warning - some scripts may be incompatible with this so
        disable with "-e0" if necessary.

    -f  By default only .pl scripts executed by persistent interpreter.
        However some Perl scripts may have .cgi extension so to accelerate
        such scripts a following regex may be used:
        *perlcgi/[^/]+\.cgi|\.pl* Where *perlcgi* stand for path so not all
        .cgi will be treated as perl but only ones from *perlcgi* folder (or
        from folder which name ends with perlcgi). This regex will be
        anchored to end of file name.

    -l  In DOing mode ( i.e. max_evals > 0 ) worker process terminates if
        upon CGI execution VmSize/VmRSS < leak treshold.

        This is helpful for scripts that are leaking memory

FAQ

    Why not fcgiwrap?

    fcgiwrap doesn't pass STDERR to web server for logging.

    What's wrong with cgiwrap-fcgi.pl? <http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI>

    Well, many things...
    - It can't DO perl scripts.
    - It is written in a strange way which is hard to read and understand.
    Frankly, it is not very beautiful.
    - It takes no options so you have to modify the code.
    - It is incompatible with some CGI applications, notably with fossil due
    to lack of support for PATH_INFO
